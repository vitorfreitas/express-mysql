# NodeJS + MySQL

Ready-to-use NodeJS + MySQL enviroment, without any configuration (just your database info).

I'm using ExpressJS and ES6 syntax (using babel), but feel free to change this as needed.

## Setting up the enviroment

You can use `git clone` to get the files. Go to your project folder and install the dependencies.

Using [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)

```bash
npm install
```

Using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

```bash
yarn
```

## Usage
I'm using a route-controller standard. Routes directory is where you set all the endpoints you need, and these endpoints will call controllers' functions.

Controllers are classes that has to be instantiated if you want to use it.
